# Changelog

## 0.1.0 - 2026-09-30

Foundation release.

### Added
- concise Agent Skill router;
- Context Router / Semantic Ledger / Voice Stack architecture;
- deterministic text analyzer;
- overlap-safe protected-span Semantic Guard;
- idiolect-oriented Voice Profile baseline;
- Regional Overfit and Dialect Mixing baseline guard;
- PT-BR, regionality and temporal-slang specifications;
- research notes for existing humanizers, ALiB, NURC and Corpus Carolina;
- regression tests and GitHub Actions CI.

### Design decisions
- semantic preservation outranks naturalness;
- author samples outrank generic regional defaults;
- regionality is distribution, not decoration;
- no AI-authorship probability score;
- no promise of detector evasion;
- observed writing features must not be converted into personal-identity inference.
